#   Write a program that prints the date and the day of the week, but allow the user to
#   choose to send the output either to a file, a scalar, or both at the same time. No matter
#   which output channels the user selects, send the output with a single print statement.
#   If the user chooses to send the output to a scalar, at the end of the program
#   print the scalarâ€™s value to standard output.
