#   Modifythe recursive directorydumping routine so it shows the nested directories
#   through indentation. An empty directory should show up as:
#
#   sandbar, an empty directory
#
#   while a nonemptydirectoryshould appear with nested contents, indented two
#   spaces:
#
#   uss_minnow, with contents:
#    anchor
#    broken_radio
#    galley, with contents:
#       captain_crunch_cereal
#       gallon_of_milk
#       tuna_fish_sandwich
#    life_preservers
