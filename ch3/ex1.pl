# Read the list of files in the current directory and convert the 
# names to their full path specification. Donâ€™t use the shell or an 
# external program to get the current directory. The File::Spec and 
# Cwd modules, both of which come with Perl, should help. Print 
# each path with four spaces before it and a newline after it, just 
# like you did for Exercise 1 of Chapter 2. Can you reuse part of 
# that answer for this problem?
